# Final Project
Boston University \\ MA 415: Data Science in R

## Summary
This project examines the similarities and differences between English and German tweets following the Facebook data scandal in April 2018. I used an API to read in tweets from Twitter and used the "tidytext" package for text mining and sentiment analysis and relied on the "lsa" and "tm" packages for German stop words. Based by my study abroad experience in Germany, many Germans are quite cautious of their privacy and go to great lengths to preserve it. The goal of this project was to examine whether there were different types of words used to communicate the same topic and whether there were different sentiments involved in expressing the same issue. Please view "5. Final_Report.pdf" for my final conclusions.

## Data Visualization
In addition to creating bar plots and word clouds, I also created an interactive R Shiny Dashboard that allows the user to customize the data visualizations themselves. There is also a Markov Chain text generator that can generate text in either English or German based on commonly seen patterns in the data. \\ Link to the Shiny Dashboard: https://tcv14.shinyapps.io/final-project/.
