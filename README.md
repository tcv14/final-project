Final Project for MA415/615 Data Science in R

The data collection files are the following: "twitter.R", "en news data.R", and "de news data.R." They reference functions that are written in the "helper functions.R" file, which should be run first.

The data/text analysis files are the following: "en data analysis.R", "de data analysis.R", and "en and de comparisons.R." Please open then in that order to ensure that the everything runs smoothly.
